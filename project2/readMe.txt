During compilation you will see 2 warning from jtb for 2 deprecated methods of it, i tried resolve thme but i couldnt, i thought they are not really essential warnings.

Notes:
1. On comparison expressions i thought only int should be compared.

4. && must have both vars as boolean
5. Print statements can only print int or booleans
